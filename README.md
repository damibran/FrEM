# FrEM
Fractional-Order Exponential Moments computation in python

Exponential moments (EMs) are important radial orthogonal moments, which have good image description ability and have less information redundancy compared with other orthogonal moments. Therefore, it has been used in various fields of image processing in recent years. However, EMs can only take integer order, which limits their reconstruction and antinoising attack performances. The promotion of fractional-order exponential moments (FrEMs) effectively alleviates the numerical instability problem of EMs; however, the numerical integration errors generated by the traditional calculation methods of FrEMs still affect the accuracy of FrEMs.

This implementation is straightforward descrite calculation. Made to complete a university machine learning project.

Exponent-~~Fourier~~ Moments definition:

$$
\operatorname{EM}_{p q}=\frac{1}{4 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{1} f(r, \theta)\left[E_{p}(r)\right]^{*} e^{-\hat{i} q \theta}  r d r d \theta
$$

$$
E_{p}(r)=\sqrt{\frac{1}{r}} e^{\hat{i} 2 \pi p r}
$$

Fractional-Order Exponential Moments definition:

$$
\operatorname{FrEM}_{p q}^{\alpha}=\frac{1}{4 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{1} f(r, \theta)\left[FrE_{p}^{\alpha}(r)\right]^{*} e^{-\hat{i} q \theta}  r d r d \theta
$$

$$
FrE_{p}^{\alpha}(r)=r^{\alpha-1} \sqrt{\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}}} e^{\hat{i} 2 \pi p r^{\alpha}}
$$

Computational formula:

$$
FrE_{nm}^{\alpha}(r, \theta)=\frac{1}{\pi N^2} \sum_{p=0}^{N-1} {\sum_{q=0}^{N-1} {f(q,p) [ FrE_n(r_{p,q})]^* e^{-\hat{i} m \theta_{p,q}}}}
$$
